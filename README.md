# Supply Chain Analysis with Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a global **supply chain and logistics dataset** to measure the effectiveness of supply chain operations and their impact on **sales performance** in the e-commerce sector.  
Key customer-centric metrics such as **Churn Rate**, **Customer Retention Rate (CRR)**, and **Repeat Purchase Rate (RPR)** are calculated to evaluate the relationship between delivery performance and customer behavior.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** → Data cleaning & transformation  
- **NumPy** → Numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** → Data visualization  
- **Datetime** → Handling time-based analysis  

## 📊 Analysis & Metrics
1. **Churn Rate** – Percentage of customers lost due to poor delivery performance (Late Delivery, Shipping Cancelled).  
2. **Customer Retention Rate (CRR)** – Percentage of customers retained month over month.  
3. **Repeat Purchase Rate (RPR)** – Share of customers making more than one purchase.  

## 📈 Visualizations
- **Churn by Delivery Status** (bar chart)  
- **Customer Retention Rate Over Time** (line chart)  
- **Distribution of Repeat Purchases per Customer** (histogram)  
- **Retention by Delivery Status** (bar chart)  

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
